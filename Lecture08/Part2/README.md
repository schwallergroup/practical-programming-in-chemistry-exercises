## Exercises

Please refer to the main [README](../README.md) for preliminary instructions. Then, the exercise for Part 2 can be followed in the main notebook [08_from_script_to_package.ipynb](08_from_script_to_package.ipynb). You will be creating your package in the [amremover](amremover) directory. 


Solutions to the standard and advanced exercises are given in [solution_standard](solution_standard) and [solution_advanced](solution_advanced), respectively. These both contain completed `amremover` packages, which can be installed from source using `pip install -e .` (provided you are in the desired `.../amremover/` directory) and used.

Happy coding!
