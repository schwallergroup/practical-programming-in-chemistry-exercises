    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you'll learn how to convert a Python script into a Python package. Packaging your code is an essential skill in software development as it promotes code reusability, maintainability, and distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the exercise is to take the existing (and very simple) `amremover_script.py` file (aka a Python *module*) and restructure it into a Python package called `amremover`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the context of digital chemistry, and more specifically computational reaction prediction or database building, there are situations where you would like to have your SMILES without atom-mapping, which may be included by default via (for example) RDKit. Although you could remove them by hand for a few reactions, it is convenient to automate atom-mapping removal with a Python tool. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `amremover_script.py` module contains python functions for removing atom mapping numbers from SMILES strings and canonicalizing them. The functionality is basic, but useful, and is a good playground for illustrating the point of this week's exercise."

    "5. Ensure that the package is properly configured and can be installed using `pip install -e .`. This involves modify the `pyproject.toml` file, with help by referring to https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/.\n",
